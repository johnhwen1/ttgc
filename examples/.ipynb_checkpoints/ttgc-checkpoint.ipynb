    "## Modifications\n",
    "This model is modified in two key ways from the model described in Guanella et al 2007. The first modification allows for added heading direction noise at each timestep, and the second introduces landmark inputs to the grid cell network. Heading direction noise is added as $\\beta_{\\text{noisy}}(t) = \\beta + \\sigma_{\\beta} r(t)$, where $\\beta$ is the unmodified bias, $\\sigma_{\\beta}$ regulates the extent of noise, and $r(t)$ is drawn from the standard normal distribution, and $\\beta_{\\text{noisy}}(t)$ is still constrained such that $\\beta_{\\text{noisy}}(t) \\in [0, π/3]$ The rotation matrix is then calculated using $\\beta_{\\text{noisy}}(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Landmark inputs are added with the addition of landmark cells and their unidirectional excitatory synaptic connections to grid cells. When landmarks are present, each landmark $L_{i}$ is associated with its own dedicated landmark cell population. A given landmark cell's activity $A_{L_{i_j}}$ is dependent on the agent's proximity to the landmark's position, where $i \\in \\{1, ..., N_L\\}$ and where $N_L$ is the number of landmarks present and $j \\in \\{1, ..., N_Ln\\}$ where $N_Ln$ is global parameter setting the number of landmark cells dedicated to each landamrk.

In the most basic form of this model, each landmark cell sends an excitatory connection to only one grid cell and contributes to its activity through the linear transfer function:\n",

    "1. The weight between each landmark cell and the $N$ grid cells is initialized randomly with values between $0$ and $1/\\sqrt N$\n",
    "2. Hebbian plasticity allows changes in weights between landmark cells and grid cells as follows:\n",
