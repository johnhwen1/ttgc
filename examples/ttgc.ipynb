    "## Modifications\n",
    "This model is modified in two key ways from the model described in Guanella et al 2007. The first modification allows for added heading direction noise at each timestep, and the second introduces landmark inputs to the grid cell network. Heading direction noise is added as $\\beta_{\\text{noisy}}(t) = \\beta + \\sigma_{\\beta} r(t)$, where $\\beta$ is the unmodified bias, $\\sigma_{\\beta}$ regulates the extent of noise, and $r(t)$ is drawn from the standard normal distribution, and $\\beta_{\\text{noisy}}(t)$ is still constrained such that $\\beta_{\\text{noisy}}(t) \\in [0, π/3]$ The rotation matrix is then calculated using $\\beta_{\\text{noisy}}(t)$.\n",

    "Landmark inputs are added with the addition of landmark cells and their unidirectional excitatory synaptic connections to grid cells. When landmarks are present, each landmark $L_{l}$ is associated with its own dedicated landmark cell population.
